## ‚öôÔ∏è Capabilities

- **Web Applications:** Responsive frontends (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Blazor, Razor Pages, Radzen) and RESTful backends with Entity Framework and SQL.

- **Desktop Applications:** Windows desktop apps using WinForms and WPF for business tooling and internal utilities.

- **Embedded & IoT:** Microcontroller development in C++ with hardware interfaces, sensor handling, and simple UI on small displays.

- **Data & Automation:** Data collection and processing pipelines, API integration, console tooling for analysis and reporting.

- **System Services:** Background services and automation with Windows Services and scheduled processes.

- **DevOps Basics:** Git-based workflows, repository organization, and continuous improvement through automated builds and tests.

- **What I can build for you:** internal admin tools, order/workflow systems, small SaaS prototypes, data collection and reporting tools, proof-of-concept IoT devices, and custom desktop utilities.

I keep expanding capabilities and can adopt new stacks as required to deliver the right solution.
